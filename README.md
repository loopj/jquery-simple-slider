jQuery Simple Slider: Unobtrusive Numerical Slider
==================================================

SimpleSlider is a jQuery plugin for turning your text inputs into draggable 
numerical sliders.

It has no external dependencies other than jQuery, and you don't need to write
a single line of JavaScript to get it to work.


How to Use
-----------

Include the javascript file in your page:

    <script src="simple-slider.js"></script>
    
Turn your text input into a slider:

    <input type="text" data-slider="true">

Touch Support

The script will automatically add touch support for mobile browsers. Please note that since this webkit, IE Mobile is not supported. Windows Phone 8 doesn't register tocuh events and the command used to detect touch in browsers will not work.
